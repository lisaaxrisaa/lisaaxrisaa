👋 Hi there! My name is Lisa <br><br>

🌟 About Me<br>
💻 I started my coding journey while blogging in college! After seeing how personalized some blogs were, I got curious, dove into HTML and CSS, and discovered how fun it was to control what you see on the browser.<br>
🌍 Fullstack web developer learning to build user-friendly websites and apps for people of all ages.<br>
🐾 Huge pet lover and proud dog mom to Emma— dreaming of combining my love of coding with my passion for animals!<br>

🎮 Fun Facts<br>
Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and traveling. Food is a big part of my life, and I love trying dishes from different cultures!<br>
